# ⚡ SkillPath – AI-Powered Personalized Learning (Demo Prototype)

A single-file, production-looking demo of **SkillPath** that showcases the full flow:
**Auth → Profile → AI Path → Mentor (with video) → Labour Forecast**.  
Everything runs client-side with `localStorage` (no backend) so it’s perfect for
quick **SIH** demos and recordings.
